# The Amy Programming Language

Amy is a strict, Haskell-like programming language that compiles to LLVM. It is
currently under heavy development, so if you happen to come across this repo
please excuse the lack of documentation. There are however some examples of
source code along with LLVM output in the
[integration-tests](integration-tests/tests/) directory.
